1. What is vulnerability scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is an automated process that uses tools to scan a system, network, or application to find and identify known security flaws. It's like a check-up to find potential weaknesses.

2. Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?

Vulnerability scanning is an automated process that identifies potential weaknesses.  Penetration testing, on the other hand, is a manual, in-depth process where an expert tries to exploit those weaknesses to see if they can break into the system.

3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?

Common vulnerabilities include outdated software, unpatched operating systems, weak passwords, and misconfigured security settings.

4. How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?

Scanners work by comparing the system's configuration and software versions against a large database of known vulnerabilities. They also test for common security weaknesses like open ports or default passwords.

5. What is CVSS?

CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System. It's an open framework for assigning a severity score to software vulnerabilities, helping organizations prioritize their security efforts.

6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?

For most organizations, scans should be performed regularly, such as monthly or quarterly. Critical systems and networks should be scanned more frequently, like weekly or after any major changes.

7.What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?
A false positive is when the vulnerability scanner flags an issue that isn't actually a real security risk. It's like the scanner crying wolf.

8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?
You prioritize vulnerabilities based on a few factors: their severity (using a scoring system like CVSS), the potential impact if exploited, and whether the asset is critical to the business. You should always fix the most severe vulnerabilities on your most important assets first.
